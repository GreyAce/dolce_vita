Hi!
First of all, it was a fun challenge,
it was interesting, everything that was done, except the time & date pickers,
was done from scratch :)
If i could, I would do it again, and refactor it alot but, as you said, it should take a couple of hours and I've
spread it over a few days already. 
anyway:

- to create the tables in your db, run the uncomment the two lines inside the app.php file (lines 20,21).
- enter your valid DB MYSQL credentials inside the ".env" file
- run "app.php" 

that's it :)

In hopes of hearing from you soon.
